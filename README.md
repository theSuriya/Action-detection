# Live Action Detection Model

An action detection model implemented in Python using OpenCV, TensorFlow, NumPy, OS, and Matplotlib. The model predicts three classes of actions in real-time from a live stream.

## Introduction

This project focuses on real-time action detection using a deep learning model built with TensorFlow. The model predicts three classes of actions and is designed to analyze live streams for immediate action recognition.

## Features

- Real-time action detection using OpenCV.
- Python implementation for flexibility and ease of use.
- TensorFlow for efficient deep learning model inference.
- NumPy for handling numerical operations.
- OS for managing file paths and system interactions.
- Matplotlib for visualization of model predictions.
